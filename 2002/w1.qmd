## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
penguins
```

```{r}
library("ggplot2")
penguins |> 
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x = bill_depth_mm, 
      y = flipper_length_mm,
      colour = sex) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Body mass (g)",
       y = "Flipper length (mm)",
       colour = "Species") +
  facet_wrap(~species + island) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
