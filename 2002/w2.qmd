```{r}
library("tidyverse") 
# If you download the data file first you can read it in using the 
# readxl package if it's in your current working directory:
fdata = readxl::read_excel("bitre_fatalities_jun2024.xlsx", sheet = 2, skip = 4, na = c("","-9"), guess_max = 1e6)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
glimpse(fdata)
```

```{r}
y_i = c(102, 32, 12, 4)
p_i = c(0.69, 0.21, 0.07, 0.03)
n = sum(y_i)
e_i = n * p_i
```

```{r}
y_i = c(  ,  ,  ,  )
p_i = c(0.5, 0.2, 0.1, 0.2)
n = sum(  )
e_i = n * p_i
```
